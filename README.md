The idea of mindful eating was inspired by solely Thích Nhất Hanh from the book Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life (HarperOne) written by Thích Nhất Hanh & Dr. Lilian Chueng. I want to take the 5 contemplations and the guide from the Plum Village Team to create my own version of mindful eating.

## Tell us about the features and technologies you used.

In a fast-paced world, I've often found myself rushing through meals, missing the simple joy in each bite. Witnessing this trend among my friends and family, I felt compelled to address it. This led to the creation of Mindful Eating to promote awareness and guide individuals in savoring their food. The app unfolds in four main phases starting with a playful game that bring attention to the benefits of mindful eating. Following this, a meditation session featuring 5 contemplations from Thich Nhat Hanh serves to calm our mind before meals. Users can then actively track their eating journey, guided by thoughtful prompts, and a chewing-to-biting ratio chart to encourage mindfulness. After the meal, a space is provided to capture personal reflections, encourage a deeper connection with mindful eating habits. For development, I used SwiftUI and its iOS17 animations for drag-and-drop, breathing balloons, and canvas drawing. I employed Observation and SwiftData to handle complex view models and data storage. ARKit tracks facial expressions to monitor mouth and jaw movements, while Swift Charts showcase collected data. To enhance the user experience, I integrated AVFoundation to feature a narrative voice and background music, adding a layer of depth to the Mindful Eating journey.

## Beyond the Swift Student Challenge

If you've used your coding skills to support your community or an organization in your area, let us know.

I led a workshop at RMIT Vietnam to help new students understand OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) better. The idea came because I and the club president felt that OOP can be tricky for beginners who might find it hard to learn just from reading and lectures. So, I made a fun Java game to show concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism, and added pictures to explain better. The positive feedback from the 2-hour session suggests that the workshop effectively clarified intricate OOP concepts for students in their coursework. I took the chance to lead a Git fundamentals workshop in the WeCamp program for women and girls at NAB Innovation Center Vietnam. My motivation was to contribute to gender equality in the tech industry by sharing my knowledge and skills. Departing from the usual method, I revealed how Git operates beneath the surface. I helped peers solve Git issues, improving their development workflow. The positive outcome of the workshop has opened up a new opportunity for me to host in StarCamp program, an internship initiative for last-year students in both Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi. This journey underscores the impact of promoting gender equality in technology through practical knowledge-sharing and skill-building initiatives.

## Comments (optional)

Is there anything else you‘d like us to know?

I didn't stand out much in high school, but my journey took a turn when I discovered CS50 during the COVID period. This introduction to coding opened up a way for me to expressing my ideas. Following my success in the Accessibility Design Competition at RMIT, where I proposed a novelty Braille writing method, my aspirations shifted towards creating impactful contributions for our community. This motivated me to learn software engineering, expanding my perspective into diverse areas like front-end, back-end, dev-ops, and mobile development. Recognizing my diligence, RMIT Vietnam honored me with the Academic Achievement Scholarship, backed by a commendable GPA of 3.9/4. As time went on, I came to realize that adding value extends beyond crafting software; it involves sharing knowledge. I spend  time to support fellow students at RMIT, WeCamp, and StarCamp learning programming skills. This competition taught me that creating value isn't solely about novel creations; it's about refining perspectives and enhancing ideas. Hence, I create Mindful Eating to introduce a new meditation app for eating and perfecting the meditation mechanism on mobile. It's my way of contributing to the improvement of people's experiences.
